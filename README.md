# Animal Ville

Animal Ville is an open source NFT crypto game, based on MATIC blockchain, where people feed and play with their pets. Any pets are supported and the release is governed by the community. The project runs on Animalville coin, a coin that gets minted when players interact with their animals. There is no central authority holding coins and there is no central governing body - we strive to create a truly decentralised game ecosystem.

# Main parts

1. Animals

The main part of ecosystem is virtual animals - pets. They have to be fed, they have to be played with and they have to have their quarters cleaned or they will eventually die. Pets are divided into species and breeds. Pets can be bred, but only specimens of the same species. 

2. Animalville coin

Animalville coin gets minted when certain actions are taken: feeding and petting the animal as well as cleaning after them. They get burned when users buy food, use the AVS in auctions for master species and when buying perks.

3. Governance

Community decides on:
- how to spend the money collected in community wallet.
- start an auction for 3 male and 3 female master breed species

We have a body of 7 Animal Ville governors - blockchain addresses that hold the most AVC tokens

Voting is always limited to 40.000 blocks after the first vote was cast. There can not be 2 votes at the same time. Voting can only be initiated by one of the governors.

Each governor has 1 vote, regardless on how many AVS tokens he/she has.
Each AnimalVille member has the same number of votes as he has AVS coins

A decision can be reached by one of two ways:
- majority of Animal Ville governors but this can be overturned by 
- majority of all tokens reaching a decision.


4. Community wallet

The money in the community wallet can be spent according to governance rules set above for following actions:
- transfering to an outside wallet (for any service provided to community - development, marketing, ...) that was decided in governance procedures
- burning the tokens.

# Milestones

1. Setting the rules
2. Creating smart contracts to implement the rules
3. Designing the animals
4. Creating a webpage where members can interact with animals
  - implement auctions
  - animal feeding
  - pet the animal
  - clean the animal
5. Create 3D animals and web based 3D user interface when ther are enough coins to finance it in the community wallet

# Rules

1.	All animals have to eat once a day at least.
2.	All animals have hunger, happiness and health meters. As any of those fall to 0, the animal dies.
3.	Happiness - play with the animal at least once a day.
4.	Wellbeing - clean after the animal.
5.	All of the above can be bought - either by smart contract or by hiring people to do it. Hiring people is cheaper - there is a minimum fee set, but people have to /can  bid.
6.	Each breed has their own master breed characters - 3 females and 3 males. 
7.	Master breed characters that get released are decided by governance.
8.	If a pet dies, it can not be recovered.
9.	A new pet can be bred. You need to put a male and female example of the same species together for 3 days at first - this span increases by an additional day for each individual pet of this species higher than 10.000 of this same species in the world.
10.	A new pet is randomly assigned to one of the owners of male and female breeder.
11.	The master species always spawn with 24h bid auction, even the first ones.
12.	The ecosystem is run by Animalville coin (AVC).
13.	AVC is minted each time a transaction is made in ecosystem - feeding, petting, cleaning.
14.	Actions can be done by non pet owners too - in that case, the owner of the pet receives 10% of AVC minted and the one doing the above service receives 90% of AVC minted.
15.	AVC is burned when used - when buying food, buying perks â€¦
16.	When buying master species in the auctions, AVC is send to the master wallet - controlled by governance.
17.	Above action can be blocked by owner - except for master species characters.
18.	Food costs 70% of AVC minted per day.
19.	Auctions of master species characters are in AVC.
20.	Pets can get perks - bought in AVC.
21.	Perks can be created by anyone - A creator receives 80% of the fees when applying theri perks to the pet, 20% of the fees get burned.
22.	The higher the amount of health, happiness and wellbeing restores, more AVC they receive.
23.	100% health gives 1 AVC, 100% wellbeing gives 1 AVC, a 100% fed pet gives 8 AVC
24.	Food costs 7AVC - it can be paid on credit so that you do not need AVC to buy food to feed the pet - you only get 1AVC for feeding the pet in that case!
